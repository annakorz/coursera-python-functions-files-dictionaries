# Project: Sentiment Classifier

Final project for Coursera course "Python 3: Functions, Files and Dictionaries"

Tha task was to build a sentiment classifier, which will detect how positive or negative are the tweets in the fake, semi-random generated twitter data provided in a csv file in the online interactive course Textbook. Additionally, we were provided with txt files with words that express positive and negative sentiment.

The task was decomposed into several steps with more detailed instructions on what should be done.

In the end, the online interpreter showed the output of the program with all the data to be uploaded to Excel file to further produce a scatterplot of the Net Score (which is how positive or negative the text is overall) vs Number of Retweets. The graph can be viewed by the following link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WsVisJ83nO_FBSM4yqC3zhlklf4AGou6Bnkykmy8DfE/edit?usp=sharing
